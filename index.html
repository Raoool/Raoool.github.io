        <p>
            My academic journey has led me to pursue a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at
            South Dakota State University (SDSU) with an anticipated graduation date in December 2023.
            My academic focus encompasses a diverse range of fields, including Image Processing,
            Remote Sensing, Geospatial Analysis, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), Medical Imaging,
            Phenology, and Data Analysis. Through my time at SDSU, I have engaged in rigorous coursework
            and valuable hands-on experiences, which have allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set
            in advanced image processing, remote sensing engineering, optical sensors, and digital image processing.
